# Bird-Deterrent-System
The Bird Deterrent System is an autonomous, multi-modal deterrent platform designed to detect and discourage birds from sensitive areas such as airports, agricultural fields, and industrial facilities. The system combines advanced sensor technology with audio and visual deterrent mechanisms to provide effective, humane bird control.
### Key Features
- **Multi-sensor bird detection** using ultrasonic sensors
- **Dual-mode deterrent system** (audio and visual)
- **Weather-resistant operation** with environmental monitoring
- **Intelligent power management** with battery monitoring
- **Real-time telemetry and monitoring** via ground station
- **Adaptive response patterns** to prevent habituation
- **Emergency shutdown capabilities**

### System Specifications
- **Detection Range**: Up to 400cm with 3-sensor array
- **Coverage Area**: 360-degree monitoring capability
- **Operating Voltage**: 12V DC primary, 5V and 3.3V rails
- **Communication**: Serial (115200 baud) with ground station
- **Environmental Rating**: Weather-protected with seal monitoring
- **Audio Output**: Variable frequency (80Hz - 24kHz)
- **Visual Output**: High-intensity LED strobes with thermal protection

## Hardware Architecture

### Core Processing Unit
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino-compatible platform
- **Processing Power**: Sufficient for real-time sensor processing and deterrent control
